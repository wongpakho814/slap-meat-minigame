# Project 3: Pet The Cheems

## Description

This slap meat minigame repository was created to complete the final project of the Monash bootcamp.

This project aims to build a fun little minigame with a live comment section and login system to conclude things I have 
learnt in the bootcamp. The amount of time the user activated the Cheems gif will be recorded to the database and displayed, 
and the comment section will be shown in the modal when the screen size shrinks to a certain pixels. This application is also
mobile friendly. 

## Installation

Please make sure to run the command "npm install" to install all required node modules before running the program. 
Please also make sure to run the command "npm run build" to build all client-side modules. 

## Usage

Please run the command "npm run develop" in terminal to start the local server.
